# Self Growth

This project is made for people struggling with procrastination. It incorporates a habit tracking function and a journal to look back on your logged activities, but the most important feature is a plant that you take care of as your productivity grows. Though it starts as a seedling, it can grow into a beautiful flower as long as you're consistent in working on yourself!
